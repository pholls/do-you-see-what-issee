### Build Something Beautiful & Meaningful

#### Learning Competencies
  * Building a web application from scratch
  * Managing the development process

#### Summary
You can choose whomever you would like to work with for this challenge. You should work by yourself.

Day 1 of phase 2 is the first day you can and should start working on your passion project. By Week 6 Wednesday, you should have reached MVP for your passion project. What you present and produce is considered in moving into phase 3. It is part of your overall assessment of how much you learned in phase 2.

You've learned a lot in phase 2: Sinatra, Active Record, JavaScript, Agile, and much more. Each of these tools is useful in its own right, but together, they give you something much more powerful — the ability to build a web application from nothing.

For this challenge, your assignment is to build something. It can be as practical or trivial as you would want, as long as it is a 100% functional, full-stack web application.

You can build anything you want, provided that it meets the following requirements:

- It has a database
- Construct a controller that has at least 1 RESTful resource
- It uses an API (what does this mean?! explore!)
- It is styled
- It utilizes JavaScript
- It is deployed to Heroku

Once you've come up with an idea, get one of your teachers to approve it.
